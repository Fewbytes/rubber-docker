# Level 0 - starting a new process (no containment)
#
# Goal: We want our code to start a new linux process using the fork & exec model
#       i.e. running:
#                rd.py run /bin/sh
#            will fork a new process which will exec '/bin/sh', while the parent waits for it to finish.
#

    #       https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.execl
    # NOTE: command is an array (first element is path/file, and the entire array is exec's args)

    pass  # TODO: remove this after adding exec

        contain(command)

    else:
        # This is the parent, pid contains the PID of the forked process
        _, status = os.waitpid(pid, 0)  # wait for the forked child, fetch the exit status
        print('{} exited with status {}'.format(pid, status))
