"""Docker From Scratch Workshop - Level 0: Starting a new process.

Goal: We want to start a new linux process using the fork & exec model.

Note: At this level we don't care about containment yet.

Usage:
    running:
        rd.py run /bin/sh
    will:
        - fork a new process which will exec '/bin/sh'
        - while the parent waits for it to finish
